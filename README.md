# Predict-Heart-Disease

This notebook looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medial attributes.

## Data

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
