# Predict-Heart-Disease

This notebook looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medial attributes.

## Data

The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease.

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

## In this notebook I've did the following:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation
7. Exporting Model

## Best evaluation
I got the best evaluation with LogisticRegression: 0.8852459016393442
